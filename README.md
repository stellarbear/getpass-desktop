* Visit [release tab](https://github.com/stellarbear/getpass-desktop/releases) for prebuild binaries and installers

This is a **temporary solution** that is build on top of [browser extension](https://github.com/stellarbear/getpass-extension). Once [this issue](https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding/issues/434) is solved, the project will fully **migrate to flutter**. This will dramatically reduce app size and significantly reduce RAM usage.
